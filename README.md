Hello, I’m @william-linville a senior studying business analytics and finacne at the University of Kansas. I’m interested in data analysis and the statistics involved with my findings. I’m currently learning Python, R studio and SQL to work with raw data to interpret and visualize results. You can reach me at wlinville26@gmail.com.
